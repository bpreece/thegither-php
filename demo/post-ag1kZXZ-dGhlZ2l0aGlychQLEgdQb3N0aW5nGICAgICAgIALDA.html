We're a small studio in Edina with some important clients.  Creativity is appreciated here.  If you can show us a portfolio of your work, that would significantly help us evaluate whether you're a fit.

Some experience with HTML5 is a plus.

Come visit us at our booth on the mezzanine level during lunch and between sessions.  We'd love to chat.</div>
